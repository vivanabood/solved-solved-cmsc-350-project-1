<ul>

 <li>Create a set of tests demonstrating that your classes work correctly.</li>

 <li>Use the GUI and classes you defined in Week to test your stack and queue classes.</li>

 <li>Methods for StackUMUC&lt;T&gt;</li>

 <li>StackUMUC (int) // constructor</li>

 <li>void push (T)</li>

 <li>T pop ()</li>

 <li>T peek ()</li>

 <li>String toString ()</li>

 <li>Methods for QueueUMUC&lt;T&gt;</li>

 <li>QueueUMUC (int) // constructor</li>

 <li>void put (T)</li>

 <li>T get ()</li>

 <li>T peek ()</li>

 <li>String toString ()</li>

</ul>
